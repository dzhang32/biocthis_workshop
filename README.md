# Developing Bioconductor-friendly packages using biocthis

This repository hosts the material for the [Ryten lab](https://rytenlab.com/) [biocthis](https://github.com/lcolladotor/biocthis) workshop.

# Prerequisites

-   A solid foundation in `R` and understanding of how to create your own functions.

-   An installation of the latest `biocthis` development version (can be installed using `devtools::install_github("lcolladotor/biocthis")` preferably on R v4.0 or above.

-   (Optionally) a function in mind that you would like to add to the example package we will create. Otherwise you will use an example function provided. If you do come with your own function, make sure it's already implemented.

# Acknowledgements

We are really grateful to [Leo](http://lcolladotor.github.io/). This workshop wouldn't have been possible without his guidance and the process of creating Bioconductor-friendly packages has been made much easier thanks to the development of [biocthis](https://github.com/lcolladotor/biocthis).
